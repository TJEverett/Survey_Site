## Description



### Basic User Stories

* A user should be able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database.
* A user should be able to fill out and submit surveys. Survey results should be submitted to the database. (A survey result can be associated to a survey by mimicking a one-to-many relationship.)
* A user should be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
* A user should have their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.
* __Bonus:__ A user should be able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys.
